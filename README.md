# Customer Support Ticket Classification With Hugging Face Sentence Transformers and Naives Bayes classifier

This project implements a customer support ticket classification system for a personal care brand which sells shower steamers. The classification system uses a pipeline with the Hugging Face Sentence Transformers model 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' and Gaussian Naives Bayes Classifier.

## Classification Approach

Utilizes embeddings generated by Hugging Face Sentence Transformers and applies Naives Bayes for classification of customer care emails into low, medium and high priority.

## Files

1. **`Synthetic data generation for customer ticket emails`**:
   - Contains the code for generating emails. This mimics the type of emails we get at our personal care company.
  
2. **`customer_emails`**:
   - Contains the emails generated by 'Synthetic data generation for customer ticket emails' file.
  
3. **`Customer support ticket classification`**:
   - Contains the classification model using Hugging Face Sentence Transformer embeddings and Naives Bayes.

## Setup Instructions

1. Run the 'Synthetic data generation for customer ticket emails' and 'Customer support ticket classification' files on Jupyter notebook.

## Usage

1. Can test for other customer care emails like in the 'Make some predictions below' section of the 'Customer support ticket classification' file.
2. The email will be classified into low [0], medium [1] or high [2] priority.
